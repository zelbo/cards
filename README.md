# cards
basic card game framework

mostly just a learning exercise for now.
basic card manipulation, ways to make various collections of cards and pass cards between collections.
can generate a deck, shuffle and sort
can display a collection with suit symbols in the console!
draw, discard, and play are all a little half-assed, needs to be designed and imlemented better
